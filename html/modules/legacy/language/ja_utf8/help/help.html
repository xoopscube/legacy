    <section id="help-blocks">

            <h3>Blocks management</h3>

            <p>The block management system is built into the kernel and provides five default block positions,
                the order of display, in which module, for which user groups and cache settings.</p>

            <p>The block position is just a legacy code convention to identify areas in the theme layout.</p>

            <p>The block template specifies the shape, and the global theme specifies the areas and appearance.
                However, it can be overridden by a custom template.</p>

            <p>There are two types of blocks : Modules blocks and Custom blocks.</p>

            <h4>Modules blocks</h4>

            <p>Modules have several pre-built blocks that offer specific functionality and favor composition over inheritance.
                These blocks are made available in the block management by enabling modules.</p>

            <h4>Custom blocks</h4>

            <p>A Custom block can be built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Smarty variables.
                Thus allowing to create reusable Components to create an effective website layout.<br>
                It can also embed code or integrate with third-party features specific to a site's unique needs.</p>
            <p>The block editor will switch according to the type of content.</p>

        <h3>Comment Management</h3>

        <p>The block management system is built into the kernel.
            It provides a text comment box where users can generate their own comments and leave them on a specific piece of content.</p>
        You can follow the last comments of your articles on your Dashboard. In addition to having a quick view, you can also give Reply to the comment as well as moderate its status as a public, unpublish, spam, and delete it.

        <h3>Word Censor</h3>

        <p>Control Panel > Preferences > Word Censorship</p>

        <p>This section of the Control Panel allows you to enable word censoring.
            It is also where you define the list of censored words.</p>

        <h4>Enable censorship?</h4>
        <p>You may enable or disable word censoring. If you select “Yes”, the system will replace any specified words
            in channel entries, comments, forum posts, etc. according to your preference below.</p>

        <h4>Replacement characters</h4>
        <p>You may optionally specify a word or phrase to be used when replacing censored words.
            For example, if you set “tisk tisk” as your replacement word, and “shucks” is in your censored list,
            then anytime “shucks” is used it will be replaced with “tisk tisk”.
            If you do not set this preference, a pound symbol will be used for each character that is censored,
            so “shucks” would be converted to “######“.</p>

        <h4>Words to censor</h4>

        <p>Specify a list of words to censor. Wildcards are allowed. For example, test* would censor the words “test”,
            “testing”, and “tester”, while *gress would censor the words “progress” and “congress”.</p>

        <p>The profanity filter, sometimes referred to as just "filter" or "censor", is a feature typically used on
            forums and comments that automatically scans users' posts as they are submitted and automatically changes
            or censors particular words.</p>

        <p>Enter the censored words in the textarea using a common delimiter character "|" (pipe) to separate the values.</p>
        <p>Set the characters replacing all the censored words in the input field "censor-replace".</p>

            <li>In 2017 major PHP projects started bug fixing and code refactoring to PHP 7.
            <li>In computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without
                changing its external behavior.
            <li>Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and implementation of the software, while preserving its functionality.
            <li>Moreover, the design and code refactoring of XCL primarily provides backward compatibility and updates modules based on Duplicatable V3 (D3) architecture.
            <li>Content creation, filemanager with cloud storage management, WYSIWYG editor and X-Update to get and deploy from a simple user interface.
