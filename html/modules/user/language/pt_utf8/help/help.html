        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p><b>User Groups</b> allows you to manage privileges and assign permissions to User groups defined in the default security realm.
        <p>The Umodule provides the best practices ensuring you have a simple, secure and scalable account authentication system.


        <p>The following features are provided by the modules Users, Message and Protector :

        <ul>
            <li>Group-based permissions
            <li>Registration : new user account and activation method
            <li>Authentication and security limit of Log in attempts
            <li>Extend User Profile with custom fields
            <li>Private Message
            <li>Blocks : Login, Users Online, New Members, Top Posters

        <h3>Group Management</h3>

        <p>Groups are used to segment users in your web application.
        You can assign users to multiple groups and grant access to modules and blocks content.
        The installation wizard creates the default User Groups and Roles :</p>

        <div data-layout="row p-7 m-auto">
            <table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 4px;padding:8px;">
            <tr><th><b>User Groups</b></th><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
            <tr class="bg-blue"><td>Webmasters</td><td>Full administrative permissions across the application</td></tr>
            <tr class="bg-green"><td>Registered Users</td><td>All users except anonymous. Permissions to read and write comments.</td></tr>
            <tr class="bg-orange"><td>Anonymous Users</td><td>Guest users or visitors, by default anonymous. Permissions restricted to read.</td></tr>
            <tr><th><b>Roles</b></th><td><b>Privilege</b></td></tr>
            <tr class="bg-blue"><td>Webmaster</td><td>Administration</td></tr>
            <tr class="bg-indigo"><td>Moderator</td><td>Forum moderation</td></tr>
        </table>
        </div>

        <div class="error">These User Groups and Roles are required by the system and cannot be deleted !<br>

        <h3>Assigning Permissions to User Groups</h3>

        <p>The ability to perform an action requires privileges.
            Usually, permissions and privileges are used interchangeably,
            but technically they have specific and different meanings in the context of web application security.
            Simply put, modules expose permissions. Users have privileges. Privileges are assigned permissions to User Groups.
            When you assign permission to a user group, you are granting a privilege to all members of the group.
        </p>

        <h6>Permissions</h6>
        <p>Declaration of the actions that can be executed on the module.

        <h6>Privileges</h6>
        <p>Permissions assigned to user groups.

    <section id="help-users">

        <h3>User Account</h3>

        <p>Access to your website is controlled by a group system by which users are assigned to User groups.
            Group permissions allow access to the content of modules and blocks.

        <p>User accounts are added through user registration and activation.
            Although Webmasters can create and activate accounts in User Management.

        <p>D3 modules, or Trust modules, can extend User Management by providing a role-based system to assign individual permissions.

        <div class="confirm">A user's permissions are determined by the sum of all group permissions to which the user belongs.</div>

        <h3>User Profile</h3>
        <p>A user account has login information, authentication, personal information fields, private messages and notification management.

        <h6>Registration</h6>
        <p>Registration to the site is allowed by default. If you are running a closed site, or need to temporarily disable registration,
            you may disable this feature by switching "Allow new user registration" to the "No" setting in the module preferences :<br>
            <span class="badge">Control Panel »» User Groups »» Preferences</span>

        <h6>Activation</h6>
        <p>Activation is a process of verifying a registered user.
            The registered user's account can be automatically activated upon registration.
            Indeed, an activated account is required to connect. However, other activation modes are available.
        <p>The Activation mode specifies the activation workflow :

        <ul>
        <li><b>Activate automatically</b> : This mode will automatically activate a user upon first registration.
        <li><b>Require activation by user</b> : Activation by following the link in the confirmation message sent to the user's email address.
        <li><b>Activation by administrators</b>: Activation by groups selected in the module preferences or by administrators via the back-end area.
        </ul>

        <p>Users have the ability to resend the activation email by clicking Send the verification email.

        <h6>Avatar</h6>
        <p>This feature allows Users to fashion their online personae called avatars. See section <a href="#help-avatars">Avatar Management</a>.

        <h6>Log in</h6>
        <p>Login credentials, typically a username and password, authenticate a user logging into an account.
        <p>Users can also reset a lost or forgotten password.

        <h6>Limit Log in Attempts</h6>
        <p>This security feature blocks an Internet address from making further attempts after a specified limit on retries is reached, making a brute-force attack difficult or impossible.
            If a user experiences too many failed sign in attempts, their account will be temporarily suspended for a period of time.
            The module Protector allows administrators to enable IP blocking on their web application, in order to block all known malicious IP addresses to reduce the risk of an attack.

        <h6>Private Message</h6>
        <p>This feature is implemented by the module Message.

        <h6>Notifications</h6>
        <p>This feature is implemented by the core system.

        <h6>Extend the User Profile</h6>

        <p>The User Profile can be easily extended by adding new fields with the module Profile.
            You can add custom fields for your users, set permissions and requirements.
            This feature can be used if you need to add additional fields that are not available by default.

        <p>Registered Users can optionally fashion their online personae called avatars.

        <p>Enable this option in the module's preferences.
        "Allow new user registration" to the "No" setting in the module preferences :<br>
        <span class="badge">Control Panel »» User Groups »» Preferences</span>

        <h3>Types of avatars</h3>

        <p>Allow users to select an avatar from a previously uploaded collection.
        <p>Or allow users to upload their own avatar :
        <ul>
            <li>Avatar image max width (pixel)
            <li>Avatar image max height (pixel)
            <li>Avatar image max filesize 1 Megabytes (MB) = 1,048,576 Bytes
        </ul>

        <p>For security reasons, the default files extensions allowed for avatars are : .GIF, .JPG and .PNG

        <div class="tips">Some Themes can generate automatically an avatar based on the first letter of the username.</div>

    <section id="help-blocks">

        <h3>Module Blocks</h3>

        <h6>Login</h6>
        <p>This module block shows the login-form for only anonymous users who still are not passing the authentication.
            If the user registration is allowed, it shows the link to create an account.
            The SSL login option ensures backwards compatibility.

        <p>Create An Account is what the anonymous user do after the sign-up.
            An account needs to be associated with a signature or profile, and often that can't be done until the user completes the registration process.
        That registration process may require them to agree to the “Terms and Conditions” : that's the sign-up part.

        <div class="tips">Note : You can log in using example.com/user.php, if you have uninstalled this block by mistake.</div>

        <h6>Users Online</h6>
        <p>This block displays the names of users likely to access your site and how many are online.
        <p>Getting correct information for online users is too cumbersome and resource consuming process.
        Therefore, this block does not attempt to display an exact result. But this should give you some insight.

        <h6>New Members</h6>
        <p>This block displays the names of users who have recently registered on your site.</p>

        <h6>Options</h6>

    <section id="help-mailjob">

        <h3>Mail Job</h3>

        <p>The mail job allows you to create job definitions that send simple email, or notifications.
            You can use MailJob to inform users of events, for example :
        <ul>
            <li>User conferences.
            <li>Networking events.
            <li>Learning Workshops.
            <li>Community events.
            <li>Outdoors activities.
            <li>Auctions and Pop-up shops.
            <li>Special guest events.
        </ul>

        <h3>Usage</h3>

        <p>Add an empty job from the control panel.
        <p>Specify a name and a label for the job.
        <p>In a next step invoke the job wizard to find users. The wizard brings up the following window :
        <p>Search Users filter according to various criteria.
        <p>Then, you can manage the job messages to users :
        <p>Retry, resubmit, and expiration.
        <p>You can customize the maximum number of retries.
        <p>This gives you the option to continue processing new events.

        <h3>Preferences</h3>

        <h6>Features in Control Panel</h6>
        <p>This article provides information specific to user management.</p>

        <h4>User module - Preferences</h4>

        <h6>Allow new user registration?</h6>
        <p>Specifies whether anonymous users can register to your site. If YES, registration is available, and <span class='highlight_block_name'>Login Block</span> shows the link to create an account (register.php).
        <p>Even if registration is deactivated, you can still add a new user in the user management.</p>

        <h6>Minimum length of password required</h6>
        <p>Specifies the minimum password length. A long password makes a password harder to guess. Of course, length is only one strong password factor. But, you should specify at least five.</p>

        <h6>Minimum length of username required</h6>
        <p>Specifies the minimum username length. This option is not about security. This is a decision to be made based on the needs of your organization.</p>

        <h6>Allow users to change email address?</h6>
        <p>Specifies whether users can change their email address in user profile editor (edituser.php). By the way, this module does not send a confirmation email for users who change their email address.</p>

        <h6>Notify by mail when a new user is registered?</h6>
        <p>If this option is Yes, the group specified by the following option can receive an e-mail notification about new user registrations.</p>

        <h6>Select a group to which new user notification mail will be sent</h6>
        <p>Specifies the group that receives the notification mail in case the previous option is Yes. The webmaster group is usually selected for this option.</p>

        <h6>Select activation type of newly registered users</h6>
        <p>After registering, a user must be activated. Being activated means being able to log in. There are several ways to activate users.</p>

        <h6>Require activation by user</h6>
        <p>This is far and away the most popular setting in the world of website systems. A user gets an activation email when they register. They are then able to login by clicking on the activation URL on the mail. This choice is satisfactory in most cases.</p>

        <h6>Activate automatically</h6>
        <p>In simple terms, there is really no activation mechanism, everyone is activated straight away. But, if you use it, you have to be careful of internet bots.
            An Internet bot, web crawler, bot, or simply bot, is a software application that performs automated tasks over the Internet. A bot can auto-register and SPAM. Therefore, this choice is only recommended for a closed segment.</p>

        <h6>Activation by administrators</h6>
        <p>A user can only be activated by direct approval of the group specified by the following option. This activation requires human intervention, and therefore seems more effective. However, this can be a time-consuming task for activators.</p>

        <h6>Select the level of strictness for username filtering</h6>
        <p>Select the strictness level for the username from the following options.</p>

        <h6>Strict (Only alphabets and numbers)</h6>
        <p>This option only allows the following characters for username.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alphabets without case-sensitive.</li>
            <li>Numbers.</li>
            <li>Under score (_).</li>
            <li>Hyphen (-).</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Medium</h6>
        <p>This option allows the following characters for username.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alphabets without case-sensitive.</li>
            <li>Numbers</li>
            <li>Underscore(_).</li>
            <li>Hyphen(-).</li>
            <li>Less than character(&lt;).</li>
            <li>Greater than character(&gt;).</li>
            <li>Comma(,).</li>
            <li>Period(.).</li>
            <li>Dollar($).</li>
            <li>Percent(%).</li>
            <li>Sharp(#).</li>
            <li>At sign(@).</li>
            <li>Exclamation point(!).</li>
            <li>Single quotation(').</li>
            <li>Double quotation(&quot;).</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Light - allow 2byte characters</h6>
        <p>This option allows all characters except control code. But this can be a cause of problem for some modules. Therefore, this option is not recommended if you are using old modules.</p>

        <h6>Allow custom avatar upload?</h6>
        <p>Specifies whether a user can upload their favorite image file as an avatar. Even if the case is No, a user can choose an avatar among the avatars made available by the administrators.</p>

        <h6>Minimum posts required</h6>
        <p>If you allow uploading of custom avatars, you don't need to set this option.</p>

        <p>This is the minimum number of posts required for users to upload a custom avatar. This decision depends on your organization's community member ranking strategy.</p>

        <h6>Avatar image max width (pixel)</h6>
        <p>Define if custom avatar upload is allowed.</p>

        <p>Specifies the limit width for the custom avatar. In the event that a user uploads an image larger than this value, this module displays an error message.</p>

        <h6>Avatar image max height (pixel)</h6>
        <p>Define if custom avatar upload is allowed.</p>

        <p>Specifies the limit height for the custom avatar. In the event that a user uploads an image larger than this value, this module displays an error message.</p>

        <p>Define if custom avatar upload is allowed.</p>

        <p>Specifies the limit filesize for custom avatar. In the event that a user uploads an image larger than this value, this module displays an error message.</p>

        <h6>Allow users to delete own account?</h6>
        <p>Specifies whether users can delete their own account in the user profile edit.
            If Yes, users can access the account deletion dialog via the user profile link (userinfo.php).
            Since these delete dialogs are very minimal, you can improve it with a notice by changing the templates --- user_delete.html, user_delete_success.html.</p>

        <h6>Execution confirmation message</h6>
        <p>This is the message displayed in the account deletion dialog. If you don't allow users to delete their own account, you don't need to edit this option.</p>

        <h6>Enter names that should not be selected as username</h6>
        <p>These are patterns that your site does not allow as usernames. Separate them with a | (pipe). This is case-insensitive and regex enabled.
            This rule does not apply to user management in the control panel. If you don't allow users to delete their own account, you don't need to edit this option.

        <h6>Enter emails that should not be used in user profile</h6>
        <p>These are patterns that your site does not allow as email address. Separate them with a | (pipe). This is case-insensitive and regex enabled.
            This rule does not apply to user management in the control panel.</p>

        <h6>Display disclaimer?</h6>
        <p>Specify whether the user registration displays the disclaimer specified by the following option.</p>

        <h6>Registration disclaimer</h6>
        <p>This is the disclaimer stated in the user registration for the anonymous user. If the previous option is No, you do not need to edit this option.</p>

        <h6>Name for user cookies</h6>
        <p>Specifies the cookie name for web browsers. In most of the cases, you don't need to change this.</p>

        <h6>Use SSL for login?</h6>
        <p>You need to install the additional login script to enable SSL connection. If YES, <span class="highlight_block_name">Login Block</span> shows the link "SSL Login".
            These options are for compatibility with XOOPS2-JP. You may be able to find a better solution to upgrade and migrate your SSL connection. The script is in the public "/html" directory.</p>

        <h6>SSL Post variable name</h6>
        <p>This option is for SSL Login, too. Specifies a name of the POST-request variable.</p>

        <h6>URL where SSL login page is located</h6>
        <p>This option is for SSL Login, too. Specifies the URL where you have installed the additional login script for SSL.</p>
