    <h3>Banner Management</h3>

        <p>Allows you to manage adverts and displays banners in your website.
            You can place a banner on any module and show it to visitors a certain number of impressions.
            An impression is a metric used to quantify the number of digital views of a client banner.

        <h3>Banner Smarty Tags</h3>

        <p>Smarty tags generate the banner content through the placement of special Smarty tags within Themes, Templates or Blocks.
            The Smarty tags are processed and substituted with the banner content : image or code html.

        <h3>Banner Client Management</h3>

        <p>Assigning a banner to a particular client will help in the long run if you’re working with several clients (i.e. customers).

        <h3>Steps for creating a new client</h3>

        <p>To setup a new banner client, follow the steps below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the button "New Banner Client"</li>
            <li>Enter the client details</li>
            <li>Enter a login and password ( allows client log in to see impressions)</li>
            <li>Enter any information to help you effectively follow up with the client</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tips">Clients can log in at example.com/banners.php</div>

        <p>If you have to manage complex campaigns for your organisation that requires analytics implementation,
            it is recommended to install an open source marketing automation tool, for example Matomo.
            Otherwise, you can migrate to XCL-Enterprise and install the CRM extension "Campaign" which includes a wide range of plugins for planning, executing, and tracking of marketing campaigns.

        <h3>Cool URI .htaccess</h3>

        <p>This feature generates a htaccess file to use Cool URI

        <p>1. Copy the generated code

        <p>2. Create a file /public_html/.htaccess

        <p>3. Past the generated code into .htaccess</p>

        <p>4. Enable "Cool URI" in General Settings

            <p>Control Panel »» System »» Preferences »» General Settings - <a href="../../legacy/admin/index.php?action=PreferenceEdit&confcat_id=1#cool-uri">🆒 Cool URI ⭢</a>

        <h3>The .htaccess File</h3>

        <p><b>.htaccess</b> files are plain-text configuration files used by the Apache HTTP web server.
            They allow users to set directory level options without requiring access to the httpd.conf file,
            including www rewrite, hotlink prevention, custom error pages, caching, and redirects.<br>
            As such it is required that your server uses Apache, and a web host that allows htaccess files (the most popular hosts do).
        </p>

    <section id="help-template">

        <h3>Template Management</h3>
        <p>Smarty Template Engine is one of the most popular and mature template engines.

        <blockquote>
            Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic.<br>
            This implies that PHP code is application logic, and is separated from the presentation.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The Render theme engine uses Themes and Templates are built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Smarty tags
            — Smarty is used with custom delimiters very similar to HTML markup language to render dynamic content.
            That makes it easier to create and design themes, templates and custom components.</p>

        <div class="tips">The renderer implementation of Smarty uses custom delimiters <b class="badge">&lt;{</b> ... <b class="badge">}&gt;</b>
            instead of Smarty code enclosed in curly brace tag delimiters {$var} of the official documentation.</div>

        <p>The Render provides an easier management of templates, even when they’re not all stored in one central directory.
            Although, some Themes have a template directory including most, if not all template files to meet an organization's needs for customization and personalization.


        <p>The distribution package comes with a Default Template Set.

        <p>When modules are installed, their templates become part of this Default Template set.

        <p>The list of Template Sets is displayed in Template Management.

        <div class="error">The Default <b>Template Set</b> cannot be deleted nor modified !</div>

        <h3>Custom Template Set</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Clone the Default Template Set to create a new Template Set
        <li>Edit the templates in your new Template Set
        <li>Once you have a new Template Set customized, you can activate it with the "Select" button.
        </ol>

        <h3>Template File Management</h3>

        <p>The list of template files allow download and editing of each file.</p>

        <div class="tips">You can upload Template Set archives in tar format through the admin interface.</div>

    </section>

    <section id="help-themes">

        <h3>Theme Selection</h3>

        <p>Theme Management allows you to "Select" the theme
            that you want to use as the default theme or main theme of your site.

        <p>Any theme that is "checked" in the "Control" column, will be available to users in the block "Themes".

        <p>If you install the block "Themes" and grant users permission, they can then select their favorite theme and customize the look and feel of the website.

        <h3>Install a Theme</h3>

        <p>Distributed themes are mostly compressed.
            To use a theme, the uncompressed files must be uploaded into the directory public_html/themes/.

        <p>The Theme folder must include theme.html and manifesto.ini.php

        <p>Additional Themes can be installed from X-Update Store, from theme-developers' websites or your custom design.

        <h3>Uninstall a Theme</h3>

        <p>The render system manages themes without using the database.

        <p>So, to delete a theme, simply delete its directory from the "themes" directory.

        <h3>AMP HTML Specification</h3>

        <p>AMP HTML is a subset of HTML for authoring content pages such as news articles in a way that guarantees certain baseline performance characteristics.
            Being a subset of HTML, it puts some restrictions on the full set of tags and functionality available through HTML,
            but it does not require the development of new rendering engines: existing user agents can render AMP HTML just like all other HTML.</p>
        <p>Also, AMP HTML documents can be uploaded to a web server and served just like any other HTML document; no special configuration for the server is necessary.
            However, they are also designed to be optionally served through specialized AMP serving systems that proxy AMP documents.</p>

        <h3>BBCode</h3>

        <p>BBCode is a simple way to format your entries (like bold text, italic text, links) in forums.
            BBCode was implemented as method of providing a safer and easier way of allowing posts to be formatted on forums.</p>

        <h3>Formatting Posts</h3>

        <p>BBCode is short for Bulletin Board Code. It is used as a way for formatting posts made on message boards, blogs and more.
            It is similar to HTML in the sense that in BBCode one does also use tags to format something specific (contained within the tag).
            In BBCode tags are indicated by rectangular brackets surrounding a keyword, which is in turn transformed into HTML before being delivered to a web browser.

            Since its creation, BBCode has been used in many different portals. Any developer can implement it for free and anyone can use it.

        <h3>Markdown</h3>

        <p>Markdown is a tool that converts simple text characters into HTML. It was created to facilitate writing on the web.
        It is very similar in purpose to BBCode, being created later (in 2004).
        Unlike BBCode, Markdown aims to avoid the use of tags wherever possible, as if the writing was just plain text.

        <h3>Markdown vs BBCode</h3>

        <p>In general, Markdown is not necessarily a competitor to BBCode, just a different and complementary way of writing on the web, which may be more suitable in certain contexts.
        <p>In general, the writing difficulty can be ordered like this:

        <p><code>Text < Markdown < BBCode < HTML</code></p>

        <p>The further to the right, the more features, and the further to the left, the simpler.
        <p>Markdown usage requires the installation of a plugin, preload or module.</p>
