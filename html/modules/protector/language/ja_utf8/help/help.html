        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>The module Protector module can defend your site against most common attacks.

        <ul>
            <li>Denial of service (DOS) attacks, bandwidth-hungry crawlers and spambots.
            <li>SQL injection, variable contamination, null bytes, session hijacking, etc.
            <li>Brute force attacks and directory traversals.
            <li>Uploading of camouflaged image files and executables.
            <li>Link and comment spammers
        </ul>
        <p>Protector logs the attacking IPs and offers a range of countermeasures including IP bans, disable access, hidden the website response and automatic sanitization of attempted injections.
        <p>The module also provides warnings of certain vulnerabilities in third-party add-ons and advices to fix them in the section <b>Security Advisor</b>.
        <p>You can define security settings and rules to a more strict web security policy mechanism.
        <p>Protector is a module developed by the trusted developer Gijoe from https://peak.ne.jp
        <p>This module is widely considered by module developers as well as other CMS as a "must have" module.

        <h3>IP Blacklist</h3>

        <p>What Is IP Blacklisting?
        <p>IP blacklisting is a method used to filter out the illegitimate or malicious IP addresses from accessing your networks.
        <p>Blacklists are lists containing ranges or individual IP addresses that you want to block.
        <p>You can use these lists in combination with firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and other traffic filtering tools.
        <p>Creating and applying blacklists enables you to filter malicious traffic according to policies or through the manual
        addition of IP addresses.
        <p>Many network security tools that use blacklists are also able to add new addresses to be blocked.
        <p>This can be done as externally referenced lists are updated or according to the results of event analysis.</p>

    <section id="help-session">

        <h3>Session Hijacking</h3>

        <p>The Session Hijacking attack consists of the exploitation of the web session control mechanism, which is normally managed for a session token.

        <p>Because http communication uses many TCP connections, the web server needs a method to recognize every user’s connections.
            The most useful method depends on a token that the Web Server sends to the client browser after a successful client authentication.
            A session token is normally composed of a string of variable width and it could be used in different ways,
            like in the URL, in the header of the http requisition as a cookie, in other parts of the header of the http request, or yet in the body of the http requisition.

        <p>The Session Hijacking attack compromises the session token by stealing or predicting a valid session token to gain unauthorized access to the Web Server.

        <p>The session token could be compromised in different ways; the most common are:

            <ul>
                <li>Predictable session token
                <li>Session Sniffing
                <li>Client-side attacks (XSS, malicious JavaScript Codes, Trojans, etc)
                <li>Man-in-the-middle attack
                <li>Man-in-the-browser attack
            </ul>

    <section id="help-dos">

        <h3>Denial of Service (DoS)</h3>

        <p>DoS attack attempts to saturate the abilities of a server
        <p>The classic typology of DoS attack consists in the continuous loading of portal portions,
            forcing the server into continually working to satisfy the demands
        <p>How the module reacts - Protector can estimate the frequency of requests to the same pages, through time and number of reloads.
        Once it matchs a pattern of the DoS attack, it can react with the following options :

        <ul>
            <li>logging the IP of the attacker
            <li>prevent access to pages containing the block "Login"
            <li>disable access or hidden the website response
            <li>blank response from server (blank page)
        </ul>

        <p>Protector can also automatically add the IP to the directory of excluded IP addresses (therefore banning the IP)

        <p>Moreover in the recent versions of the module it is possible to deny the access to the website through the use of the htaccess file
        (even if this functionality is still at the experimental level).

        <p>Some modules, for example the live chat module, are frequently updated by the users' browser to follow
        the continuous flow of information that is modified.
        In order to prevent users from using such modules as indicated for an attack, it is possible to define which modules escape anti-DoS control.

    <section id="help-crawler">

        <h3>Bad Crawlers</h3>

        <p>A crawler is an indexing motor and information collector (for example an email sender in a forum spamming)
        <p>It is considered a <b>bad crawler</b> when too frequently request are carried out.
        <p>Protector reacts by applying the same criteria of DoS to the <b>bad crawler</b> and provides the following options :

        <ul>
            <li>show only a page containing the login block
            <li>disable access, hidden the website response
            <li>blank response from server (blank page)
            <li>banning the IP
            <li>block from .htaccess (experimental)
        </ul>

    </section>


    <section id="help-sql">

        <h3>SQL Injection</h3>

        <p>SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.
            Such code injection technique might destroy your database. SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
        <p>Protector can react by blocking various types of SQL injection attacks:

        <ul>
            <li>monitoring and surveillance
            <li>prevent attempts in isolated comments
            <li>monitoring the syntax of union operator in SQL
            <li>prevent invalid data from being inserted into fields key
        </ul>

        <p>Important actions are audited (security, queries, executes, logins, etc.) and Protector can react in the following ways:

        <ul>
            <li>show only a page containing the login block
            <li>data sanitization before sending it to the database
            <li>blank response from server (blank page)
            <li>banning the IP
        </ul>
        <p>Protector sanitizes the input before sending it to the database. Thus, parameterized queries can prevent SQL injection.

    </section>


    <section id="help-xss">

        <h3>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>

        <p>These attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign third-party add-ons of websites.
        <p>XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses an third-party add-on installed in the web application to send malicious code,
        generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.
        <p>Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere an input from a user generates an output without validation or encoding.
        <p>It is recommended to install add-ons tested and stable, developed by a trusted developers recognized for reliability and competence.

        <p>Protector, being in fact a particularly powerful module itself, can only intercept part of these attacks by sanitizing data (see SQL injection attacks).

    <section id="help-var">

    <h3>Contamination of Global Variables</h3>

    <p>A malicious attack can override variables leveraging user-supplied, untrusted query variables directly used on the
        application server without any data sanitization. In extreme cases, the attack can change variables controlling
        the business logic of the application. For instance, in languages like PHP, a number of poorly set default configurations
        may allow the user to override variables.</p>
    <p>Protector can react in the following ways:

    <ul>
        <li>show only a page containing the login block
        <li>landing page
        <li>banning the IP
    </ul>
