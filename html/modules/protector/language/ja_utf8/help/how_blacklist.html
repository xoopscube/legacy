<h3>IP Blacklisting Challenges</h3>
<p>Although blacklisting is a good way to prevent specific IPs from accessing your network, it is not a foolproof method.
    This is because attackers have developed multiple ways to get around blacklisting. These methods include:</p>

<h3>1. Changing IP addresses</h3>
<p>Many attackers work to avoid getting put on blacklists in the first place by periodically changing their IP address.
    Criminals may have a range of addresses that they use, enabling them to swap addresses if they find that one is blocked.
    These changes also make it more difficult to track attackers, reducing the risk of prosecution.</p>

<h3>2. IP spoofing</h3>
<p>In case of network layer attacks (e.g. DDoS attacks that don’t require a full three-way TCP connection),
    attackers can use IP spoofing to make it appear as though they are connecting via a different IP address.
    This enables them to bypass blacklisting while obscuring their identity.
    It can also enable them to trick monitoring systems into thinking that compromised credentials are being used legitimately.</p>

<h3>3. Botnets</h3>
<p>Many attackers operate massive botnets, including thousands to millions of end-user devices or Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
    The attackers compromise these devices and take control over them, or in many cases, rent a botnet as a service on the dark web.</p>

<p>Due to the increased availability and size of botnets, many attacks are performed using very large numbers of
    IP addresses, which may constantly change as devices join and leave the botnet.
    IP blacklists cannot defend against this attack scenario.</p>

<h3>4. False positives</h3>
<p>False positives are another challenge you might face when implementing blacklists.
    Although not related to attackers or security, these challenges can still interrupt productivity.</p>

<h3>5. Inaccurate IP detection</h3>
<p>Another challenge is if you have multiple individuals using the same IP address.
    When IP addresses are dynamically assigned you have no way of knowing who the end-user currently using an address is.
    This means that if you block one user due to abusive actions,
    you may accidentally prevent a legitimate user from accessing your network in the future.</p>
