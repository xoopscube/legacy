 * @brief This class manages XCube_Service instances, searches these, creates a much
 * client instance. Now, the purpose of this class is for inside of own XOOPS
 * site. In other words, this class doesn't work for publishing web services.
 * About these separated working, the core team shall examine.
 *
 * XCube namespace can't contain the SOAP library directly.
 * Delegate mechanism is good for this class. This class creates a client instance
 * which connects to a service, following the kind of the service.
 * For example, if the specified service is really a web service,
 * the SOAP client has to be created. But, if the service is a virtual service of XCube,
 * virtual client has to be created.
