 * [Abstract] Used for initialization, post-processing and other purposes by the controller.
 * This class is an abstract class.
 * Typically, an abstract defines an interface for other classes to extend.
 * @package    XCube
 * @version    XCL 2.5.0
 * @author     Other authors gigamaster, 2020 XCL/PHP7

 *
 *    This class is chained and called by the initialization procedure of the controller class.
 *    Developers or users can use the subclass to customize dynamically.
 *
 *    Users usually do not need to add filters because each controller have sufficient initialization code.
 *    This class is used in case of special customization of modules and users.
 *
 *    A controller must not use this class in its initialization procedure.
 *
 *    Two member functions are called by the controller at the proper time.
 *    The timing is different for each controller.
