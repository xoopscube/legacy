<h3>Documentation</h3>
<h4>Help</h4>
<p>The XCL bundle provides advanced search functionality and includes built-in help for each module.</p>
<h4>Support</h4>
<p>The XOOPSCube Project has maintained a focus on providing a simple, secure, and scalable web application platform in the twenty years since its initial development as an alternative to XOOPS2. XOOPSCube Legacy reached its end-of-life on April 20, 2024, and is only receiving maintenance updates.
</p>
<h4>Options for Integrators</h4>
<p>Itâ€™s crucial to emphasize the importance of maintaining a secure software environment. Therefore, XOOPSCube 2.5.0 does not include X-Update Manager notifications. For those interested in using the latest, secure version of XContainer, reach out to us regarding obtaining an enterprise license.
