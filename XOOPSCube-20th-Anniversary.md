                First developed nearly 20 years ago, the original XOOPS was based on PHPNuke forks,  
                although about 70 to 80% of the code was rewritten, as Kazumi Ono (onokazu) wrote on  
                the release announcement. Goghs Cheng (goghs) and Kazumi Ono (onokazu) used "OOPS",  
                an acronym that stands for "Object-Oriented Portal System".  
                - Xoops.org was launched on December 12, 2001. 
                - A few weeks later, on New Year's Day 2002, XOOPS RC1 was released. 
                - And the next year, in April 2003, XOOPS2 was released by Kazumi Ono 
                - Finally, in May 2005, Onokazu announced the development of XOOPSCube.  
                The XOOSCube Project developoment was lead by Kazuhisa Minato (minahito)
                and the core team members Nobunobu, Onokazu, Tom_G3X, Ryuji, Kilica.
                The new core was enriched with C++ features, object-oriented programming, 
                following concept of oops like polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, 
                abstraction. The Japanese XOOPS community contributed to the development 
                of the Package Legacy, a set of modules to ensure backward compatibility.
