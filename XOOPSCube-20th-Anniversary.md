Originally conceived nearly two decades ago, XOOPS evolved from PHPNuke forks. However, as Kazumi Ono (onokazu) noted in the release announcement, approximately 70 to 80% of the codebase underwent a rewrite. Goghs Cheng (goghs) and Kazumi Ono (onokazu) coined the acronym "OOPS," which stood for "Object-Oriented Portal System," to describe their approach.

Key milestones in XOOPS' early history include:

- The launch of Xoops.org on December 12, 2001.
- The release of XOOPS RC1 a few weeks later, on New Year's Day 2002.
- The subsequent release of XOOPS2 by Kazumi Ono in April 2003.

Later, in May 2005, Onokazu announced the development of XoopsCube. This new project was spearheaded by Kazuhisa Minato (minahito) and a core team comprising Nobunobu, Onokazu, Tom_G3X, Ryuji, and Kilica. XoopsCube's core was significantly enhanced with C++ features and embraced object-oriented programming principles, embodying OOPS concepts such as polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction. To facilitate a smooth transition for existing users, the Japanese XOOPS community contributed the Package Legacy, a collection of modules designed to ensure backward compatibility.

  This foundational core lead to the development of the complete XOOPSCUBE Legacy project, 
  including modules, themes, and a broader set of APIs.
