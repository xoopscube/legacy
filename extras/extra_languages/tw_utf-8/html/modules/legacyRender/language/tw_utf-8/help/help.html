<h4>Outline</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This rendering engine (renderer) is for themes of XOOPS 2.0.x/XOOPS JP 2.0.x.</li>
  <li>It has neither override nor the fall-back mechanism. Smarty is used for rendering and the cache management. The renderer is medium speed. Please see package.ini.php for specs and details.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Additional themes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Additional themes can be obtained on theme-developers' websites etc.</li>
  <li>Distributed themes are mostly compressed. To use a theme, the uncompressed files must be in the /themes directory of your site. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Uploading of themes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Please upload the folder of the decompressed theme to the /themes directory under the root directory of XOOPS Cube. The folder should include theme.html or package.ini.php. First download the theme and expand it on your local machine. Then upload the entire folder. <i>If your host has server-side decompressing available then upload the compressed file to the /themes folder and uncompress on the server.</i></li>
</ul>

<h4>Selection of themes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In Theme Management, please click the "Select" button next to the theme that you wish to use as the default theme or main theme of your site.</li>
